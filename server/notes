- Followed Kolban's youtube tutorial on setting up a C++ project, that worked
- Followed Kolban's esp32-snippets/cpp_utils/README about how to bring in that folder as local components in your project
- Ran make menuconfig and enabled bluetooth (since I started with a non-bluetooth template from esp)
  Enabling bluetooth also fixed weird includes/class not declared issues since Kolban's code disables bluetooth following whether or not it's enabled in the menuconfig
- Then everything compiled okay.
